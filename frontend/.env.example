# Backend API Configuration
# For development, use the local backend server
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

# For production, set this to your backend API URL
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourapp.com

# ============================================================================
# Notes:
# ============================================================================
# The frontend automatically adapts to backend capabilities:
# - If storage is enabled on backend, replay and analytics features work
# - If storage is disabled, comparisons work normally with URL-based sharing
# No additional frontend configuration needed for storage features
